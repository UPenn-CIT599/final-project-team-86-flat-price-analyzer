Summary of MyProperty:

The aim of MyProperty is to analyse how property prices have changed in Singapore over the past 15 years so users looking to purchase a flat in Singapore can be better informed when making their decision.

We have 3 main sections: 
- Property Index: the tab shows how housing prices (by flat type) have changed in the past 15 years
- Location Insight: the tab shows how property prices in different locations in Singapore have changed 
- Mortgage Calculator: this allows users to find out their estimated monthly installments
